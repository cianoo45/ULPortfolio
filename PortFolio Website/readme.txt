This is the code for my portfolio website, the website is live here: https://cianoo45.github.io/PortfolioSite/#
but the repository also contains the backend code that will host the site on your localhost,
This is done through the Flask framework in Python.

N.B , The version live on github will not serve the CV as it is not using the Flask code
